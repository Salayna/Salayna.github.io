Because I am a smart man I yeeted myself into a project I had little infos on 😃, true man of wisdom. And to top I was like “Yeah I’ll just make the components on the fly. I’ll learn SDL and OpenGL while working on the project 🤡”. But ayy isn't this whole dev log about honnesty and mistakes ?  
Anyway, a friend of mine gave a really good idea(honestly a smart idea, but somehow me and 7 auxiliary brains didn’t think about it). Making and trying pieces of software in a vacuum, which is the best way to actually learn. For people that don’t understand, it means that I’ll be making small pieces of software where I try concepts, for example a small app where I render buttons, another one where I make a character move and so on. Want more examples ? Can we continue ? Thank You.  
I’ll probably be making that for few months, I still have School, Work and other stuffs on the fire. Yeah baby we kinda busy out here baby (so @Comfrt on twitch).  
I’ll be probably making a GitHub repo with multiple programs in it so y’all can easily copy my home works. I think I’ll be making these Dev Logs once a month cause I can’t AND I don’t want to see you a lot, once a month is good enough(Let’s take it easy between us 😊).
I think I’ll end the Dev Log here, catch you in one month or so and stay cute til next time ❤️.  
Also I might change my website cause I don’t like it handles images and I find it quite ugly so I’ll probably migrate the blog to a specialized provider OR still go with "GitHub Pages" cause I’m a broke boy 😄
